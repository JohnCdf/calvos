        desc: "Ford says it will boost its investment in electric vehicles to $11 billion (£8bn) in the next five years, more than doubling a previous commitment. Chairman Bill Ford said the car maker would have 40 hybrid and fully electric vehicles in its range by 2022. It comes as countries around the world put more pressure on car makers to rein in carbon emissions. General Motors, Toyota and Volkswagen have already outlined ambitious plans to offer more electric vehicles. Speaking at the Detroit Auto Show on Sunday, Mr Ford said the focus would be on electrifying existing Ford models without naming any specific cars. He said the firm would offer 16 fully electric vehicles by 2022 and 24 plug-in hybrids."

        desc: "Nissan took the wraps off the Xmotion -- say \"cross motion\" -- concept at the Detroit auto show on Monday, using the sharply-styled compact crossover to showcase Japanese heritage and aesthetics, and demonstrate how contrasting design attributes can coexist in a single vehicle. The design team took inspiration from architecture, landscapes and traditional crafts in designing the Xmotion to offer a window into Nissan's next generation of crossovers and SUVs. Note that the Xmotion concept isn't meant as a preview of an impending production model, even though the Xterra has been notably absent from the lineup for a few years. Rather, the concept attempts to chart a new direction in Nissan SUV design, while anticipating a future dominated by autonomous driving tech. 'The Xmotion concept is a study in how seemingly disparate elements can gain power and strength through coexistence,' said Alfonso Albaisa, senior vice president of global design at Nissan 'It draws inspiration from the Japanese aesthetics and techniques that have been passed down through generation after generation. At the same time, it achieves the modern purposefulness required for drivers in the near-future era of connected, autonomous crossover vehicles'. <hr/> <img src='http://hanabi.autoweek.com/sites/default/files/styles/gen-738-415/public/Nissan_Xmotion_Concept___Photo_27.jpg?itok=MZsueHms'/> <br/>The concept still features Nissan's familiar V-motion grille, but just about all other parts of the front fascia have been sculpted in a new way, emphasizing a high window sill line and vertical side treatment. Inside, the sparsely-detailed cabin anticipates autonomous technologies of the future with a series of wide screens positioned just below the windshield. The interior is bisected by a single, light-colored console; this is one of the elements inspired by traditional crafts, in this case Japanese wood joinery techniques. Nissan says that this technique uses neither glue nor a single nail, and that it is known for its durability and strength. \"Careful attention was especially paid to the grain direction, texture and even the aroma of genuine wood to look and feel as if the whole instrument panel and console were cut out of a single Japanese cedar tree,\" Nissan says. \"Out of respect for resource efficiency, the solid wood look was achieved by using genuine wood overlays, which were sliced out of a single tree that was selected from the woods in Yamagata Prefecture in northern Japan."

        title: "Tesla Model 3 will get more features controlled by voice command, says Musk",
        imagesrc: "https://cdn.teslarati.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/tesla-model-3-autopilot-traffic-steering-wheel-2.jpg",
        desc: "In a recent set of tweets this weekend, Tesla CEO Elon Musk announced that more voice commands would be rolled out to the Model 3 as it continues to evolve towards full autonomy. Tyson Edwards, a photographer from Phoenix, AZ, asked Musk on Twitter if Model 3 owners can look forward to more voice-activated features in the future. According to Edwards, Model 3’s minimalistic interior require drivers to take their attention off the road, when accessing the vehicle’s suite of features that are largely controlled by the touchscreen interface. Doing so might ultimately make it a hazard for drivers. Responding to the electric car enthusiast, Musk promptly stated that such improvements are definitely on the way, while further asserting that drivers would pretty much be able to do “anything” via voice commands. Musk explained that the enhancements to the Model 3’s voice-activated features would be rolled out as soon as the vehicle’s core functionality was completed. "

        imagesrc: "https://blog.caranddriver.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/2019-Mercedes-AMG-E53-coupe-and-cabrio-PLACEMENT-626x383.jpg",
        desc: "Like the mechanically identical 2019 Mercedes-AMG CLS53, the E53 coupe and cabriolet are powered by a turbocharged 3.0-liter inline-six producing a stout 429 horsepower at 6100 rpm and 384 lb-ft of torque from 1800 to 5800 rpm. Helping the straight-six achieve that output is a hybrid-assist system using a 48-volt primary electrical system called EQ Boost. An electric compressor and a combination starter/alternator serve up an extra 21 horsepower and 184 lb-ft. In essence, EQ Boost is similar to Audi’s hybrid-assist system in the 2019 A8, but instead of a starter/alternator driven off an engine belt, Mercedes uses an electric motor mounted between the engine and the nine-speed automatic. The starter/alternator powers the electric supercharger to peak boost in milliseconds, minimizing lag before the standard turbo awakes."

        desc: "Sedan sales of late have taken a crossover-shaped hit, but they're still a hugely significant part of the automotive landscape. Toyota's all-new 2019 Avalon shows that the automaker continues to take the sedan segment seriously. Historically, the Avalon has been the Camry's larger, cushier brother. That fundamental brief doesn't change, but the relationship promises big strides in ride composure for Toyota's slightly-bigger-than-Camry midsize Avalon sedan. Riding on the same global platform that underpins the current Camry, the new Avalon's dimensions have changed in much the same way the Camry's did. The new Avalon's wheelbase grows by 2 inches compared to the outgoing car, and height drops by about an inch, as does the base of the windshield and the seating position of the driver. It's also slightly wider and has shorter overhangs. Meanwhile, the Avalon's entirely new stying echoes the edginess and aggression of the Camry's sheet metal. In the bargain, the new Avalon receives a multilink rear suspension, replacing the outgoing car's strut-based setup. This move promises improvements to ride quality without sacrificing the car's handling acuity. Touring models receive continuously variable dampers as standard equipment. Toyota says all models are quieter, too. The new Avalon will be offered in four trim levels — XSE, Touring, XLE and Limited — all of which pilfer their powertrains from the Camry. The sole traditional powertrain on offer is Toyota's familiar 3.5-liter V6 and eight-speed automatic transmission, while hybrid models have a 2.5-liter four-cylinder and a continuously variable automatic transmission. Both of them drive the front wheels only. There's no word yet on how powerful these offerings will be, but it's a safe bet they'll deliver similar horsepower as in the Camry (301 hp and 203 hp, respectively). Cabin space, particularly for backseat passengers, has been a perennial hallmark of the Avalon. Things don't change much in this regard for 2019 — there's an inch more rear legroom and a half-inch less rear headroom. Up front, a huge panel housing a new 9-inch touchscreen and climate controls dominates the center of the dashboard. Like a smartphone, this screen supports swipes and pinches. And as in the Camry Hybrid, the Avalon Hybrid's nickel-metal-hydride battery resides beneath the back seat and doesn't impact the trunk's cargo volume. Many other automakers have offered Apple CarPlay going on years now, but Toyota has been loath to integrate the smartphone interface into its vehicles. That ends with the 2019 Avalon, which is the first Toyota vehicle to be equipped with Apple CarPlay. It's standard equipment as part of the Entune 3.0 infotainment system. It's also the first Toyota to integrate Amazon Alexa connectivity, enabling owners with suitable devices to lock or unlock the doors, check the fuel level, or start the engine. Given how much better the current Camry drives than its predecessor, we expect the 2019 Toyota Avalon will deliver across-the-board improvements. It reaches dealerships in late spring this year."

        desc: "2017 Cadillac CTS performance sedans have successfully demonstrated vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) technology in a test on Michigan roads. As previously reported by Edmunds, beginning in March, the CTS began coming standard with vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V)  technology, which allows the Cadillac to communicate wirelessly with other V2V-equipped vehicles and warn drivers of potential dangers ahead on the road. Now, in this recent test, CTS development vehicles received information directly from traffic-signal controllers, alerting the driver of safety, mobility or environment-related conditions before they could become an issue. The traffic signals, located adjacent to the GM Warren Technical Center campus, were able to send real-time data using dedicated short-range communications (DSRC) protocol to the development vehicles, which alerted the drivers of a potential red light violation at their current speed. This alert helps drivers avoid making the potentially dangerous decision of either braking abruptly or accelerating through a busy intersection. The U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) refers to V2I as \"the next generation of Intelligent Transportation Systems\" and notes that state and local agencies are likely to begin installing the necessary infrastructure alongside their existing systems in the near future. The DOT anticipates that V2I, V2V and other connected-vehicle technology will result in significant improvement in traffic safety and efficiency, especially if the vehicles \"can respond automatically to roadway conditions reported by roadside equipment or other roadway users,\" without the need for driver intervention. Unlike V2I, which will require infrastructure that is capable of DSRC transmissions, the Cadillac V2V system uses existing GPS technology for positioning and in-car DSRC communication to transfer information between vehicles. This allows the technology to work now, as long as nearby vehicles are similarly equipped. For the moment, V2I technology is still largely experimental, with a number of municipalities, researchers and automakers working on its development. But, as Cadillac says, the successful CTS demonstration, as well as other tests, \"lays the groundwork for a connected, safer future.\""
